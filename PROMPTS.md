Prompt used for the app:

Build a travel planning application that uses AI to generate personalized itineraries and provide smart destination recommendations. The app features two main interfaces: a Builder for creating detailed travel plans and a Chat for getting destination suggestions.
The Builder allows users to input trip parameters including destination, duration, companions, budget, and style preferences. The AI generates structured day-by-day itineraries with time-blocked activities, considering user preferences and budget constraints. Include a drag-and-drop interface for reordering activities with automatic time recalculation.
The Chat provides personalized destination recommendations based on travel history, analyzing user preferences and past trip patterns. The AI maintains conversation context and offers specific suggestions with detailed activity descriptions.
Built using Cloudflare Workers for serverless backend, D1 SQLite database for persistent storage, and Groq API for fast LLM inference. Features include saving/loading trips, deleting plans, and maintaining user preferences. The frontend should be responsive with smooth navigation and modern design.
